As a Project Manager and Data Analyst with over a decade of experience in civil and environmental engineering, I bring technical expertise and a data-driven approach to project management. Holding advanced degrees in Construction Management and Civil Engineering, along with certifications like PMP and Microsoft Certified: Power BI Data Analyst Associate, I excel in using tools such as Excel, SQL, R, Python, and Power BI to drive successful project outcomes. My career highlights include leading projects to on-time and within-budget delivery, developing comprehensive plans, performing risk assessments, and implementing quality control measures.
